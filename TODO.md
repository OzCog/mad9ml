# Plan for Implementing Missing and Incomplete Features

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for identifying and addressing missing and incomplete features, as well as replacing mock implementations with production-ready features in the `EchoCog/shiny-train` repository.

## Current Situation

- [x] **ErrorBoundary** component created (`marduk-frontend/src/ErrorBoundary.tsx`).
- [x] **useWebSocket** hook scaffolded (`marduk-frontend/src/useWebSocket.ts`).
- [x] **Logger** with pino set up (`logger.js`).
- [x] **/health** endpoint added to backend (`server.js`).
- [x] **lru-cache** refactor for context management (`marduk-ts/core/ai/ai-coordinator.ts`).
- [x] **Integrate ErrorBoundary** into `App.tsx` (wrap at top level). 
- [x] **Refactor WebSocket usage** in `App.tsx` and `Dashboard.tsx` to use new hook. 
- [x] **Add user notifications** for connection/error states (now uses react-hot-toast for toast notifications).
- [x] **Advanced backend task prioritization implemented** (`task-manager.ts`, `task_execution.ts`). 
  - Added weighted/dynamic priority logic, inheritance, decay, and helper methods.
  - Enhanced `TaskMessage` type with new prioritization fields.
  - Updated prioritization algorithms and added `getNextTask()` convenience method.
  - Next: integrate retry logic and resource-aware execution into `task_execution.ts`.
- [x] **Task Execution Enhancements** - Add retry logic, resource-aware execution, and improved error handling in `task_execution.ts`. *(Completed 2025-05-04)*
- [x] **Implement memory optimization strategies** in `memory-optimization.ts` and `memory-persistence.ts`.
- [x] **Update TODO.md** as progress is made.

*Remaining items from PLAN.md and previous TODOs are below for reference.*

- `marduk-frontend/src/App.tsx` lacks comprehensive error handling and reconnection logic for WebSocket connections. 
- Context management in `marduk-ts/core/ai/ai-coordinator.ts` uses a simple cache mechanism, which may not be sufficient for complex scenarios. 
- Task prioritization and execution logic in `marduk-ts/core/task/task-manager.ts` and `marduk-ts/core/task_execution.ts` could be enhanced to handle more complex dependencies and conditions. 
- Integration between subsystems, such as memory, AI, and task management, could be improved for seamless communication and data sharing. 
- User interface in `marduk-frontend/src/App.tsx` and `marduk-frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` could be improved for better user experience. 
- Logging and monitoring mechanisms in `marduk-ts/core/logging/logger.ts` and `marduk-ts/core/monitoring/health-monitor.ts` need to be more comprehensive.
