## Usage

```typescript
// Initialize core components
import { 
  mardukCore, 
  memoryFactory, 
  aiCoordinator 
} from 'marduk-ts';

// Query memory subsystems
const memory = memoryFactory.getSubsystem('semantic');
const results = await memory.query({
  type: 'concept',
  term: 'chaos theory'
});

// Process with AI
const enhanced = await aiCoordinator.processQuery(
  'Explain the relationship between chaos theory and dynamic systems',
  { maxTokens: 500 }
);

// Monitor system health
const health = await healthMonitor.checkHealth();
console.log('System Status:', health.status);
```
