# 2025-05-04 21:41 â€” Task Execution Enhancements Implemented

## Files Updated
- `marduk-ts/core/task_execution.ts`
- `marduk-ts/core/task/types/task-types.ts`

## Changes Made
### `task-types.ts`
- Added `retryCount?: number` to `TaskMessage` interface for tracking retry attempts.

### `task_execution.ts`
- Enhanced `executeTasks()`:
  - Added **retry logic** (max 3 retries) with detailed logging for each attempt.
  - Implemented **resource-aware execution**: defers tasks if resource availability < 0.5 or if system load > 0.8 with high resource cost (>50).
  - Added **dependency checking**: defers tasks if dependencies are unmet.
  - Improved **error handling and logging** for all outcomes (success, defer, fail, retry).
- Added `checkDependencies()` helper function to validate dependency completion.

## Next Steps
- Test retry and resource-aware logic under varied system conditions.
- Consider memory optimization or frontend error handling next (per TODO.md).

# Summary
Task execution now supports retries, resource awareness, dependency checks, and detailed logging. Ready for testing or to move to the next priority area.
