# 2025-05-04 21:03 â€” TypeScript React Types Installed

## 1. Overview
TypeScript lint errors related to missing React and JSX types were blocking further frontend improvements. The correct React type packages have now been installed using the proper npm command for the user's Powershell environment.

## 2. Steps Taken

### 2.1 Fixed package.json Syntax
- Removed invalid JavaScript-style comment from the `deploy:webcontainers` script in `package.json`.

### 2.2 Installed TypeScript Type Declarations
- Ran:
  ```powershell
  $env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\nodejs"; & "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
  ```
- This successfully installed the required type definitions for React and ReactDOM.

## 3. Next Steps
- Re-run your build and lint commands to confirm that the TypeScript errors are resolved.
- Continue with frontend improvements, such as adding toast/snackbar notifications for errors.
- Consider running `npm audit fix` to address the moderate vulnerability reported by npm.

## 4. File Actions
- `marduk-frontend/package.json`: Fixed JSON syntax.
- `wiki/chat/2025_05_04_21_03_typescript_types_installed.md`: This session log.
