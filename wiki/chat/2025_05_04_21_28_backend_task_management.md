# 2025-05-04 21:28 â€” Backend Task Management Improvements

## 1. Overview
This session begins backend improvements, focusing on task prioritization, execution logic, and context management in the TypeScript backend modules. All steps will be documented for clarity and reproducibility.

## 2. Steps To Be Taken
- Audit `marduk-ts/core/task/task-manager.ts` and `marduk-ts/core/task_execution.ts` for current prioritization and execution logic.
- Implement or enhance:
  - Robust prioritization algorithms (weighted queues, dynamic adjustment)
  - Handling of complex dependencies and conditions
  - User-defined priorities, priority inheritance, and decay
  - Error handling and logging
- Document changes and update TODO.md.

## 3. File Actions (Planned)
- `marduk-ts/core/task/task-manager.ts`: Prioritization, dependency handling, logging
- `marduk-ts/core/task/task_execution.ts`: Execution logic, error handling
- `wiki/chat/2025_05_04_21_28_backend_task_management.md`: This session log

# Summary
Backend task management improvements initiated. Next, will audit and enhance task-manager and task_execution modules for robust, production-ready logic.
