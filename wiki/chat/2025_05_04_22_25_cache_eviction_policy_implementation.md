# Chat Log: Cache Eviction Policy Implementation (2025-05-04 22:25)

## Objective
Enhance AI context management in `marduk-ts/core/ai/ai-coordinator.ts` by implementing a sophisticated cache eviction policy.

## Steps

1. **Created Advanced Cache Utility**
   - Created `advanced-cache.ts` with a `WeightedLRUCache` implementation
   - Implemented importance-based scoring that considers:
     - Recency (when item was last accessed)
     - Frequency (how often item is accessed)
     - Weight (importance/relevance of item)
     - Age (slight penalty for very old items)
   - Added TTL extension for important items
   - Implemented cache monitoring with statistics tracking

2. **Updated AiCoordinator**
   - Replaced basic LRU cache with our new WeightedLRUCache
   - Updated cache key generation to use significant terms for better matches
   - Enhanced cache item structure to store relevance scores and query term history
   - Added relevance calculation with vector similarity for query-context pairs
   - Implemented cache hit/miss tracking and statistics reporting
   - Made caching decisions more intelligent based on content relevance

3. **Updated AI Config**
   - Added cacheLimit setting to ai-config.ts
   - Set default cache size to 200 items

4. **Added Analytics**
   - Integrated cache performance into confidence scores
   - Added getCacheStats method for monitoring cache usage
   - Implemented detailed logging of cache evictions

## Benefits of Enhanced Cache Eviction
- Important context persists longer in cache (weighted by relevance)
- Automatic TTL extension for frequently accessed items
- More intelligent cache key generation for better hit rates
- Performance monitoring through detailed cache statistics
- Graceful degradation with fallbacks at every level

## Next Steps
The planned sequence of improvements continues with:
1. ✅ Vector Embeddings for Semantic Similarity 
2. ✅ Enhanced Cache Eviction Policy
3. Context Persistence Across Sessions (next task)
4. Context Enrichment from Additional Sources
