# Context Persistence Implementation

## User Request
Implement context persistence across sessions to maintain AI contextual information even after system restarts.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Created Context Persistence Utility

Developed a dedicated utility class for managing the persistence of context data:

- Created `ContextPersistence` class with save/load capabilities
- Implemented automatic snapshot mechanisms for versioned backups
- Added file system handling with error recovery
- Included process exit handlers for safe shutdown

**File:** `marduk-ts/core/ai/utils/context-persistence.ts`

### 2. Updated AI Coordinator

Enhanced the AiCoordinator to integrate with the persistence system:

- Added automatic loading of persisted context on startup
- Implemented scheduled saving of context updates
- Added API methods for manual persistence management
- Enabled snapshot listing and restoration functionality

**File:** `marduk-ts/core/ai/ai-coordinator.ts`

### 3. Extended AI Configuration

Added configuration options to control persistence behavior:

- Added `enableContextPersistence` setting to toggle persistence features
- Added `contextPersistenceInterval` setting to control auto-save frequency
- Set sensible defaults (enabled, 5-minute interval)

**File:** `marduk-ts/core/ai/config/ai-config.ts`

### 4. Fixed TypeScript Errors

Resolved type-related issues in the implementation:

- Added proper error handling with typed catch clauses
- Ensured proper interface implementation

### 5. Updated TODO.md

Updated the TODO.md file to reflect completed work:

- Marked context persistence task as completed
- Added details about specific implementations

**File:** `TODO.md`

## Key Features Added

1. **Automatic Context Preservation**: Context is automatically saved at regular intervals and during system shutdown
2. **Versioned Backups**: Snapshots provide point-in-time recovery options
3. **Configurable Behavior**: Persistence can be enabled/disabled and intervals adjusted
4. **Seamless Integration**: Works transparently with the existing context system
5. **Error Resistance**: Robust error handling for storage operations
6. **Management API**: Methods for manual persistence operations

## Technical Notes

The implemented solution stores context data in JSON format in a directory structure that separates active context from snapshots. This approach allows for easy backup and recovery while maintaining efficiency.

The persistence mechanism is designed to work asynchronously in most cases to avoid blocking the main execution thread. However, it falls back to synchronous operations during system shutdown to ensure data is not lost.

## Next Steps

The next planned enhancement is to implement **validation checks for context data accuracy and consistency**, which would further improve the reliability of the context system.
