# Task Execution Logic Enhancements

## User Request
Complete the task-related improvements by implementing enhanced task execution logic with better condition handling and improved error management.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Advanced Condition Expression Evaluation

Enhanced the condition evaluation system with:

- **New 'threshold' Operator**: Added a powerful new operator that allows tasks to execute when X out of Y conditions are true
- **Detailed Condition Tracing**: Implemented comprehensive debug logging of condition evaluation steps
- **Context-Aware Evaluation**: Conditions now receive execution context including task ID for better tracing
- **Robust Error Handling**: Added proper error capture and safe failure modes for condition evaluation errors

The condition expression system now supports four logical operators:
- `and`: All conditions must be true
- `or`: At least one condition must be true
- `not`: Negates a single condition
- `threshold`: Requires X conditions out of Y to be true (defaults to majority if threshold not specified)

### 2. Task Execution Timeout Management

Implemented sophisticated timeout handling:

- Added `executionTimeout` property to the `TaskMessage` interface
- Created Promise-based timeout mechanism with proper cleanup
- Ensured timeouts are properly logged and reported
- Added support for task-specific timeout values or global fallback

### 3. Robust Error Handling

Significantly improved error handling throughout the task execution process:

- **Error Collection**: All errors are now captured and returned as part of execution statistics
- **Fail-Fast Mode**: Added configurable fail-fast behavior that halts execution on critical errors
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Enhanced error logging with structured contextual information
- **Safe Default Behaviors**: All error paths have sensible defaults for graceful degradation

### 4. Execution Options

Added new execution options to the `executeTasks` function:

- `debugMode`: Enables verbose logging for execution troubleshooting
- `failFast`: When true, stops execution immediately on fatal errors
- `maxConcurrent`: Controls concurrent task execution limits
- `timeoutMs`: Default timeout value for all tasks (can be overridden per task)

## Technical Details

The implementation uses several techniques to ensure robust task execution:

1. **Promise-based Timeout**: Uses Promise with setTimeout for clean task timeout management
2. **Hierarchical Condition Evaluation**: Supports arbitrarily nested condition expressions
3. **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive execution statistics including error collection
4. **Context Propagation**: Execution context flows through the entire evaluation chain

## Code Examples

### Condition Evaluation with Threshold

```typescript
const complexCondition: TaskConditionExpression = {
  operator: 'threshold',
  threshold: 2,  // At least 2 conditions must be true
  conditions: [
    { type: 'deferred', prerequisite: 'topic1' },
    { type: 'deferred', prerequisite: 'topic2' },
    { type: 'deferred', prerequisite: 'topic3' }
  ]
};
```

### Task Execution with Options

```typescript
const result = await executeTasks(
  taskQueue,
  memoryState,
  resourceMonitor,
  {
    debugMode: true,
    failFast: false,
    timeoutMs: 60000  // 1 minute default timeout
  }
);
```

## Next Steps

The task-related improvements are now complete, making the task system much more robust and flexible. Future enhancements could include:

1. Dynamic condition expression construction based on runtime requirements
2. Machine learning-based condition prediction for task optimization
3. Performance profiling and metrics for execution optimization
4. Enhanced task execution visualization and monitoring tools
