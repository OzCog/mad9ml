# Context Enrichment Enhancement Implementation

## User Request
Enhance the AI context management system by integrating additional memory subsystems and external data sources for better context enrichment.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Created Context Sources Framework

Created a flexible context source architecture to standardize how different data sources provide context:

- Created the base `ContextSource` interface to define a common API
- Developed the `ContextSourceManager` to coordinate multiple sources
- Implemented a standardized `ContextItem` format for all sources

**File:** `marduk-ts/core/ai/utils/context-sources.ts`

### 2. Implemented Memory Subsystem Adapters

Created adapters to integrate all memory subsystems with the new context framework:

- `SemanticMemoryAdapter`: For concepts and relationships
- `DeclarativeMemoryAdapter`: For factual knowledge
- `EpisodicMemoryAdapter`: For events and experiences
- `ProceduralMemoryAdapter`: For workflows and processes
- `UserActivityAdapter`: For tracking recent user interactions

**File:** `marduk-ts/core/ai/utils/memory-adapters.ts`

### 3. Enhanced AiCoordinator

Updated the AiCoordinator to use the new context sources system:

- Replaced direct memory subsystem queries with the context source manager
- Added robust error handling with legacy fallback mechanism
- Implemented user activity tracking
- Enhanced context formatting and source attribution

**File:** `marduk-ts/core/ai/ai-coordinator.ts`

### 4. Updated AI Configuration

Added configuration support for the context sources system:

- Added `maxSourcesPerQuery` setting to control how many sources are queried
- Fixed TypeScript lint errors in implementation

**File:** `marduk-ts/core/ai/config/ai-config.ts`

### 5. Updated TODO.md

Updated the TODO.md file to reflect completed work:

- Marked context enrichment tasks as completed
- Added details about specific implementations
- Documented the next tasks to be addressed

**File:** `TODO.md`

## Key Features Added

1. **Multi-source Context Enrichment**: Consolidated context from multiple sources including all memory subsystems (semantic, declarative, episodic, and procedural)
2. **User Activity Tracking**: Tracked user queries to provide more personalized context
3. **Document-based Context**: Added support for document-based contextual information
4. **External API Framework**: Laid groundwork for external API integration (e.g., web search APIs)
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Implemented graceful degradation with legacy fallback mechanisms
6. **Source Attribution**: Enhanced context formatting with source attribution for transparency

## Next Steps

1. Implement context persistence across sessions
2. Add validation checks for context data accuracy
3. Test the system with various query types to ensure robust performance

## Technical Notes

The implementation follows a modular design pattern, allowing easy addition of new context sources in the future. Each source can implement its own relevance calculation while still adhering to a standardized interface.
