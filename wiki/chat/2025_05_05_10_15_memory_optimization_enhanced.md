# Memory Optimization Enhancements

## Overview

I've enhanced the memory management system in `shiny-cog` to better handle larger datasets through improved compression, deduplication, and persistence strategies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Memory Optimization (`memory-optimization.ts`)

- Added detailed logging for compression and deduplication triggers.
- Implemented emergency cleanup for critical memory usage (above 95% capacity).
- Enhanced metadata tracking for compressed items.
- Added TODO comments for future advanced compression implementations.

### 2. Improved Memory Persistence (`memory-persistence.ts`)

- Implemented batch processing for saving memory items with detailed logging.
- Added metadata storage to track save operation details.
- Enhanced loading mechanism to process batch files with progress logging.
- Added metadata loading for insights into the last save operation.

## Next Steps

- Review these changes to ensure alignment with project goals.
- Consider implementing advanced compression algorithms as noted in the TODO comments.
- Update `TODO.md` to reflect the completion of these memory optimization enhancements.
