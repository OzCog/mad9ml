# 2025-05-04 21:40 â€” Task Execution Enhancements

## 1. Overview
Continuing backend improvements, now focusing on enhancing task execution logic in `task_execution.ts`. This includes retry logic, resource-aware execution, and improved error handling.

## 2. Steps To Be Taken
- Update `executeTasks` to:
  - Implement retry logic for failed tasks (with configurable max retries).
  - Add resource-aware checks before execution (skip/queue if resources low).
  - Enhance logging for all outcomes (success, defer, fail, retry).
- Add helper methods if needed for retry or resource checks.
- Document changes and update TODO.md.

## 3. File Actions (Planned)
- `marduk-ts/core/task_execution.ts`: Add retry logic, resource checks, logging.
- `wiki/chat/2025_05_04_21_40_task_execution_enhancements.md`: This session log.

# Summary
Task execution enhancements initiated. Next, will update `task_execution.ts` for robust retry logic and resource-aware execution.
