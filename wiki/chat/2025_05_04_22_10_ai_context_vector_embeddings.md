# Chat Log: AI Context Vector Embeddings (2025-05-04 22:10)

## Objective
Enhance AI context management in `marduk-ts/core/ai/ai-coordinator.ts` by implementing vector embeddings for semantic similarity.

## Steps

1. **Initial Assessment:** Identified that we needed to move beyond string-similarity for context relevance towards vector embeddings.

2. **Vector Similarity Implementation:**
   - Created a new `VectorSimilarity` utility class in `vector-similarity.ts`
   - Implemented OpenAI embeddings API integration
   - Added embedding cache to reduce API calls and improve performance
   - Implemented cosine similarity for comparing embedding vectors
   - Added batch processing for efficient handling of multiple texts

3. **AiCoordinator Update:**
   - Modified `rankAndFilterContext` to use vector-based similarity
   - Updated all functions to use async/await for embedding operations
   - Added graceful fallback to string similarity when embeddings fail
   - Split the relevance calculation into semantic (vector) and lexical (string) methods

4. **Type Definitions:**
   - Created `embedding-types.ts` with interfaces for embeddings and similarity operations
   - Added type definitions for embedding vectors, API responses, and configuration options

## Benefits of Vector Embeddings
- Improved semantic understanding (meaning, not just words)
- Better handling of synonyms and related concepts
- More accurate ranking of relevant context
- Resilience through fallback mechanisms

## Next Steps
The planned sequence of improvements is:
1. âœ… Vector Embeddings for Semantic Similarity 
2. Enhanced Cache Eviction Policy
3. Context Persistence Across Sessions
4. Context Enrichment from Additional Sources
