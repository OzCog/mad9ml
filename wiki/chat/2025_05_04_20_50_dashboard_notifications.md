# 2025-05-04 20:50 â€” Dashboard Notifications & Error Handling

## 1. Overview
This session focused on enhancing error notification support in the `Dashboard` component and integrating it with the main `App` for improved user feedback when WebSocket or metrics errors occur.

## 2. Steps Taken

### 2.1 Refactor `Dashboard` for Notification Support
- **File:** `src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Change:**
  - Added an optional `notify` prop to the `DashboardProps` interface.
  - When a metrics parsing error occurs, the `notify` callback is called (if provided), allowing the parent to display a notification or toast.
  - Updated the effect dependencies accordingly.

### 2.2 Integrate Notification in `App`
- **File:** `src/App.tsx`
- **Change:**
  - When rendering `<Dashboard>`, passed a `notify` function that currently uses `alert(msg)` to show error notifications to the user.

### 2.3 Wrap App in ErrorBoundary
- **File:** `src/main.tsx`
- **Change:**
  - Confirmed the root `<App />` is wrapped in `<ErrorBoundary>` for global UI error handling.

## 3. Lint & TypeScript Feedback
- Numerous lint errors remain, mostly related to missing React/JSX type declarations and implicit `any` types.
- Next steps should include installing `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to resolve these errors and improve type safety.

## 4. Next Steps
- Replace the placeholder `alert` notification with a more user-friendly toast/snackbar system.
- Address TypeScript and lint errors by installing type packages and refining type annotations.
- Continue backend improvements as previously planned.
- Update `TODO.md` and `PLAN.md` accordingly.

## 5. Terminal/Commands Used
- No terminal commands run in this step, but recommend:
  - `npm i --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom`

## 6. File Actions
- `src/components/Dashboard.tsx`: Added `notify` prop and logic.
- `src/App.tsx`: Passed notification handler to `Dashboard`.
- `src/main.tsx`: Confirmed error boundary usage.
- `wiki/chat/2025_05_04_20_50_dashboard_notifications.md`: This session log.

# Summary
Enhanced error notification handling in the dashboard, enabling parent-driven notifications. Next, address TypeScript lint errors and improve the notification UI.
