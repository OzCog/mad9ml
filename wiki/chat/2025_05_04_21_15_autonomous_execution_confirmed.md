# 2025-05-04 21:15 â€” Autonomous Execution Confirmed

## Context
The user has confirmed that I should proceed autonomously through the full TODO/PLAN, applying best practices and documenting each step, only stopping for blockers or critical ambiguities. The user has robust backups and has already implemented the plan themselves for verification, but seeks a shareable, best-practice implementation.

## Next Steps
- Proceed through TODO.md and PLAN.md in order:
  1. Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high-contrast mode)
  2. Responsive design
  3. Theming and customization
  4. Backend/task management improvements
  5. Memory optimization and persistence
  6. Documentation and logging
- Document each step in a timestamped markdown file in `wiki/chat/`
- Update TODO.md after each major step
- Only stop for blockers or critical ambiguities

# Confirmation
Autonomous, best-practice, and fully documented execution authorized by user. Proceeding with accessibility improvements next.
