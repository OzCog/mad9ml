# Health Monitoring System Enhancement - 2025-05-05

## Summary
Enhanced the health monitoring system in the `health-monitor.ts` file to provide comprehensive system monitoring, alerting, and performance tracking capabilities. This completes the TODO items for both logging enhancements and health monitoring improvements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Interface Definitions
- Created `HealthStatus` type with values: 'healthy', 'degraded', 'unhealthy', 'critical'
- Implemented comprehensive interfaces for monitoring:
  - `ResourceUtilization` - CPU, memory, disk, and process metrics
  - `AlertConfig` - Alert threshold configuration
  - `ResponseTimes` - Performance metrics for AI, memory, and API components
  - `Alert` - System alert with severity levels
- Expanded `SystemHealth` interface with additional monitoring data

### 2. Improved Health Monitor Class
- Added comprehensive tracking variables to the `HealthMonitor` class:
  - Response time tracking for AI, memory, and API components
  - Alert history with cooldown tracking
  - Component failure tracking
  - Health check caching
- Implemented automated monitoring with configurable intervals
- Added application version tracking

### 3. Implemented Monitoring Capabilities
- Added resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- Created response time tracking with percentile calculations
- Implemented configurable alert system with cooldown prevention
- Enhanced error handling with consecutive failure tracking

### 4. Added Health Check Methods
- Enhanced memory, AI, and task health check methods
- Implemented sophisticated status determination logic
- Added metrics collection and calculation
- Created summary reporting methods

### 5. Added Recovery Mechanisms
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for health check failures
- Added system reset capabilities
- Created health and metrics logging with appropriate severity

## Terminal Commands Used
None - All changes were made through direct file editing.

## Files Modified
- `d:\casto\gh\shiny-cog\marduk-ts\core\monitoring\health-monitor.ts` - Enhanced with comprehensive monitoring
- `d:\casto\gh\shiny-cog\TODO.md` - Updated to mark health monitoring as completed

## Next Steps
The `PLAN.md` file still needs to be created as per the TODO list.
