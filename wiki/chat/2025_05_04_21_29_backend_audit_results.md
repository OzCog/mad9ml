# 2025-05-04 21:29 â€” Backend Task Management Audit Results

## Files Audited
- `marduk-ts/core/task/task-manager.ts`
- `marduk-ts/core/task_execution.ts`

## Current State
### `task-manager.ts`
- Has a `TaskManager` class with:
  - Task queue management (add, get, clear)
  - Prioritization (basic numeric, dynamic adjustment, priority inheritance, decay)
  - Categorization by type
  - Logging via `logger`
- Lacks advanced prioritization (weighted queues, real-time adjustment, user-defined priorities)
- Dependency and decay logic present but could be more robust

### `task_execution.ts`
- Exports `executeTasks` and `checkCondition` functions
- Executes tasks if their conditions are met, logs execution and errors
- Lacks advanced error handling, retry logic, or resource management
- No support for complex task dependencies or dynamic execution order

## Next Steps
- Implement advanced prioritization (weighted queues, dynamic adjustment, user-defined priorities)
- Enhance dependency and decay mechanisms
- Improve error handling and logging in execution
- Add support for retry logic and resource-aware execution

# Summary
Backend audit complete. Proceeding to implement advanced prioritization, robust dependency management, and improved execution logic.
