# 2025-05-04 21:16 â€” Accessibility Improvements

## 1. Overview
This session implements accessibility best practices in the Marduk frontend, focusing on keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high-contrast mode. All changes are documented for clarity and shareability.

## 2. Steps Taken
- Added ARIA labels and roles to key UI elements (headers, message containers, input fields, buttons).
- Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible (tab order, button roles, focus management).
- Improved color contrast and added a high-contrast toggle for visually impaired users.
- Updated documentation and TODO.md accordingly.

## 3. File Actions
- `src/App.tsx`: Added ARIA attributes, improved tab order, and made interactive elements accessible.
- `src/App.css`: Improved color contrast and added styles for high-contrast mode.
