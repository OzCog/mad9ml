# Task Management Categorization & User Priority Enhancements

## User Request
Continue with the remaining task management improvements, focusing on category-specific prioritization rules and user-defined priorities.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Category-Specific Prioritization Rules

Added a comprehensive system for categorizing tasks and applying specific rules for each category:

- Created `CategoryPrioritizationRule` interface with the following properties:
  - `name`: Category name (e.g., "io", "cpu", "memory", "ai")
  - `baseMultiplier`: Base priority multiplier for this category
  - `minPriority` / `maxPriority`: Boundaries for task priorities in this category
  - `systemLoadImpact`: How much system load affects this category (0-1)
  - `batchSize`: Preferred batch size for processing tasks in this category
  - `customFactors`: Category-specific priority calculation factors
  - `allowParallel`: Whether tasks in this category can run in parallel
  - `maxParallelTasks`: Maximum number of parallel tasks if allowed
  - `isPreemptive`: Whether tasks in this category can preempt other tasks

- Implemented default categories:
  - `default`: Standard prioritization (base multiplier: 1.0)
  - `io`: I/O tasks with parallel execution capability (base multiplier: 0.9)
  - `cpu`: CPU-intensive tasks with higher resource sensitivity (base multiplier: 1.2) 
  - `memory`: Memory-intensive batch processing tasks (base multiplier: 1.1)
  - `ai`: High-priority AI processing tasks (base multiplier: 1.5)
  - `system`: Critical system operations with minimum priority floor (base multiplier: 2.0)
  - `user`: User-initiated tasks with very high user factor (base multiplier: 1.8)
  - `background`: Low-priority background tasks with priority ceiling (base multiplier: 0.5)

- Enhanced priority calculation to take category-specific factors into account:
  - Applied category multipliers to final priority scores
  - Enforced category-specific minimum and maximum priority constraints
  - Adjusted resource sensitivity based on category configuration

### 2. User-Defined Priority System

Implemented a flexible and user-friendly priority expression system:

- Added `userPriorityExpression` field to the `TaskMessage` interface
- Created a parser for symbolic priority expressions that supports:
  - Simple named priorities: "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW", etc.
  - Relative adjustments: "HIGH+2", "MEDIUM-1", etc.
  - Automatic conversion to numeric priority values (1-10 scale)

- Priority levels mapping:
  - "CRITICAL": 10
  - "HIGH": 8
  - "MEDIUM": 5
  - "LOW": 3
  - "LOWEST": 1

- Implemented validation to ensure priorities remain within valid ranges (0-10)

## Technical Notes

The implementation supports:

1. **Mixed Priority Systems**: Combining numeric priorities with symbolic expressions
2. **Adaptive Category Rules**: Categories that respond differently to system conditions
3. **Flexible Priority Inheritance**: Priority boosts that propagate through dependency chains
4. **Category-Specific Resource Management**: Different parallelism rules based on category
5. **Priority Aging & Decay**: Configurable per category to prevent task starvation

## Next Steps

With these enhancements, the task management system is now much more flexible and capable. Future improvements could include:

1. Dynamic category rule adjustments based on system performance metrics
2. Machine learning for optimizing category parameters based on execution patterns
3. Priority prediction based on historical task performance
4. User preference learning for priority expressions

## Query and Response

### User Query:

lets continue with these remaining task management improvements
```

### Cascade Response Summary:
Implemented category-specific prioritization rules and enhanced user-defined priority handling in the TaskManager:

1. Created a CategoryPrioritizationRule interface with properties for configuring how different task categories are prioritized
2. Implemented default categories (io, cpu, memory, ai, system, user, background) with appropriate settings
3. Enhanced priority calculation to apply category-specific rules, multipliers, and constraints
4. Added support for user-friendly priority expressions like "HIGH", "LOW+2", etc.
5. Updated the TaskMessage interface to include userPriorityExpression field
6. Fixed TypeScript errors in the implementation
7. Updated the TODO.md file to mark all task management improvements as completed
