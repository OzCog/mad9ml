# Memory Persistence Enhancement Session

## Summary
Enhanced the memory persistence system with improved error handling, data integrity checks, and backup capabilities.

## Steps Performed

1. **Analyzed memory-persistence.ts Issues**
   - Identified multiple issues including duplicated class definitions and broken structure
   - Found missing error handling mechanisms

2. **Created Enhanced Implementation**
   - Created a fresh implementation of `MemoryPersistence` class
   - Located at: `d:\casto\gh\shiny-cog\marduk-ts\core\memory\utils\memory-persistence.ts`

3. **File Actions**
   - Saved temporary implementation to `memory-persistence-fixed.ts`
   - Used PowerShell to replace the original file with the fixed version

4. **Key Enhancements Added**
   - **Custom Error Classes**:
     - `MemoryPersistenceError` and `DataIntegrityError` for better error handling
   - **Data Integrity**:
     - Implemented checksums for file integrity verification
     - Added verification methods before loading data
   - **Backup System**:
     - Automatic backup creation before file modification
     - Backup restore capabilities when integrity checks fail
   - **Performance Optimizations**:
     - Batched processing for large datasets
     - Configurable batch sizes
   - **Resilience**:
     - Retry logic with exponential backoff
     - Graceful failure handling
   - **Snapshot System**:
     - Versioned snapshots with timestamp identifiers
     - Methods to save and load snapshots

5. **Updated TODO.md**
   - Marked memory-persistence.ts tasks as completed
   - Added detailed descriptions of completed enhancements

## Terminal Commands Run
```powershell
Copy-Item -Path "d:\casto\gh\shiny-cog\marduk-ts\core\memory\utils\memory-persistence-fixed.ts" -Destination "d:\casto\gh\shiny-cog\marduk-ts\core\memory\utils\memory-persistence.ts" -Force
```

## Next Steps
- Continue with memory-optimization.ts enhancements
- Test the memory persistence functionality
- Update related components to leverage new capabilities
