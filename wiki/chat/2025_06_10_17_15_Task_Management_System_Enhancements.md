# Task Management System Enhancements

## User Request
Enhance the task management system by implementing advanced prioritization logic, complex dependency handling, sophisticated conditions, and real-time dynamic adjustments.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Enhanced Task Prioritization Logic

Developed a sophisticated task prioritization system:

- Created a configurable priority calculation system with multiple weighted factors
- Implemented priority inheritance through dependency chains
- Added boost mechanisms for critical and aging tasks
- Designed factor-based priority calculation with contextual awareness

**Files:**
- `marduk-ts/core/task/task-manager.ts`
- `marduk-ts/core/task/types/task-types.ts`

### 2. Advanced Task Dependencies and Conditions

Enhanced dependency handling and condition evaluation:

- Implemented bidirectional dependency tracking (dependencies and dependents)
- Added complex condition expressions with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Created dependency state notification system for automatically unblocking tasks
- Added validation for circular dependencies

**Files:**
- `marduk-ts/core/task/task-manager.ts`
- `marduk-ts/core/task_execution.ts`
- `marduk-ts/core/task/types/task-types.ts`

### 3. Resource-Aware Execution

Added resource awareness to task execution:

- Implemented system resource monitoring for various resource categories
- Created reservation system for task resource requirements
- Developed automatic resource release after task completion
- Added protection against system overload by deferring non-critical tasks

**Files:**
- `marduk-ts/core/monitoring/system-resource-monitor.ts`
- `marduk-ts/core/task_execution.ts`

### 4. Dynamic Priority Adjustments

Implemented dynamic priority adjustment mechanisms:

- Added age-based priority boosts for long-waiting tasks
- Implemented priority decay for old, uncompleted tasks
- Created system for promoting critical tasks during high load
- Designed time-based and event-based priority recalculation

**Files:**
- `marduk-ts/core/task/task-manager.ts`

## Key Features Added

1. **Priority Factors System**: Configurable weights for different aspects affecting task priority
2. **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time tracking and management of system resources
3. **Complex Conditions**: Logical expressions for fine-grained task execution control
4. **Task Relationships**: Bidirectional tracking of dependencies and dependents
5. **Auto-Unblocking**: Automatic notification and status updates when dependencies complete
6. **Execution Stats**: Detailed statistics tracking for task execution
7. **Task Batching**: Ability to execute multiple tasks in optimized batches
8. **Category Management**: Task organization and filtering by logical categories

## Technical Notes

The implementation uses a combination of:

1. **Priority Calculation Formulas**:
   - Base priority component
   - User-defined priority component (highest weight)
   - Urgency component adjusted by system load
   - Age component for fairness
   - Resource cost penalty
   - Stalled task boost
   - Context availability boost
   - Failure history penalty
   - Dependency inheritance boost

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Category-based resource tracking (CPU, memory, network, etc.)
   - Reservation and release mechanisms
   - Load monitoring with configurable thresholds
   - Critical task protection

3. **Execution Lifecycle**:
   - Pre-execution validation (dependencies, conditions, resources)
   - Execution with resource management
   - Post-execution cleanup and notification
   - Error handling with configurable retry logic

## Next Steps

Possible future enhancements could include:

1. **Machine Learning for Priority Prediction**: Use historical data to predict optimal task priority
2. **Distributed Task Management**: Extend for multi-system task distribution
3. **Advanced Scheduling Algorithms**: Implement deadline-aware scheduling
4. **Visualization Tools**: Create dashboards for task system monitoring
5. **Domain-Specific Rules**: Add customizable rules for specific task categories
