# Marduk Architecture Overview

Marduk is built on a modular cognitive architecture with four primary subsystems working in harmony to create a powerful, flexible foundation for advanced AI applications.

## Core Principles

The Marduk architecture is guided by several key principles:

1. **Cognitive Mimicry**: The system architecture mirrors human cognitive systems where possible
2. **Modular Design**: Components are discrete and can be developed, tested, and optimized independently
3. **Introspective Capability**: The system can analyze and optimize its own operations
4. **Layered Processing**: Information flows through multiple processing layers
5. **Pattern Recognition**: The system actively identifies patterns in its memory and operations

## System Interactions

The four subsystems interact in complex patterns:

- **Memory System** stores information that the **Task System** uses for execution
- **AI System** provides intelligence capabilities that enhance both memory and task operations
- **Autonomy System** monitors and optimizes all other systems

These relationships create a network of interdependencies that allow for sophisticated emergent behaviors.

## Information Flow

Information in Marduk flows through several stages:

1. **Input Processing**: External information enters the system
2. **Memory Integration**: New information is contextualized against existing memory
3. **Task Allocation**: The system determines what actions to take based on the integrated information
4. **Execution**: Tasks are performed, potentially generating new information
5. **Self-Analysis**: The system evaluates its performance
6. **Optimization**: Changes are made to improve future operations

This cyclical flow creates a continuous learning and improvement process.

## Technical Implementation

At the technical level, Marduk is implemented in TypeScript with:

- Strong typing throughout the system
- Event-driven architecture for reactive processing
- Asynchronous operations for performance
- Persistent storage for memory systems
- WebSocket communication for real-time interactions
- Modular code organization reflecting the cognitive architecture
