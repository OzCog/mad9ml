# Marduk Core Subsystems

Marduk's power comes from four deeply integrated subsystems that work together to create a complete cognitive architecture. Each subsystem has its own specialized focus but shares data and capabilities with the others.

### Detailed Subsystem Diagrams
- **[üß† Memory System Architecture](memory-system-mermaid.md)** - Memory subsystem architecture, consolidation processes, neural-symbolic integration, optimization pathways
- **[‚öôÔ∏è Task System Architecture](task-system-mermaid.md)** - Task orchestration patterns, execution flows, dependency management, cognitive integration
- **[ü§ñ AI System Architecture](ai-system-mermaid.md)** - AI coordination, model routing, knowledge graph integration, context management
- **[üîÑ Autonomy System Architecture](autonomy-system-mermaid.md)** - Self-optimization, meta-cognition, recursive improvement, consciousness emergence

## Memory System

The [Memory System](memory-system.md) provides sophisticated storage and retrieval capabilities across four distinct memory types:

- **Declarative Memory**: Stores facts and explicit knowledge
- **Episodic Memory**: Records temporal sequences and events
- **Procedural Memory**: Contains workflows, methods, and procedures
- **Semantic Memory**: Maintains concepts, relationships, and meaning networks

## Task System

The [Task System](task-system.md) manages the planning and execution of operations:

- **Scheduler**: Prioritizes and sequences tasks
- **Manager**: Tracks execution state and handles resources
- **Validator**: Confirms task structure and prerequisites
- **Handlers**: Specialized processors for different task types

## AI System

The [AI System](ai-system.md) provides intelligence services:

- **Coordinator**: Manages AI resource allocation
- **Clients**: Interfaces with external AI providers
- **Integration**: Connects AI capabilities with other subsystems
- **Types**: Defines structured data formats for AI interactions

## Autonomy System

The [Autonomy System](autonomy-system.md) enables self-improvement:

- **Analysis**: Examines system performance and patterns
- **Optimizer**: Implements improvements to system operations
- **Monitor**: Tracks system health and metrics
- **Heartbeat**: Maintains essential operations and failsafes

Each subsystem has its own page in this wiki with detailed information about its architecture, usage, and capabilities.
