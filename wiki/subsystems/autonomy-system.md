# Autonomy System

The Autonomy System enables Marduk to analyze and improve its own operations, creating a self-optimizing cognitive architecture.

## Components

### Analysis

The Analysis component examines system performance and patterns:

- Code analysis
- Performance profiling
- Pattern detection
- Inefficiency identification

**Technical Implementation**: `CodeAnalyzer` and pattern detection classes.

### Optimizer

The Optimizer implements improvements to system operations:

- Code optimization
- Memory reorganization
- Task reallocation
- Resource optimization

**Technical Implementation**: `CodeOptimizer` and other optimization classes.

### Monitor

The Monitor tracks system health and metrics:

- Resource usage
- Error rates
- Performance metrics
- Operational statistics

**Technical Implementation**: `AutonomyMonitor` class with metric collection.

### Heartbeat

The Heartbeat maintains essential operations and failsafes:

- System continuity
- Error recovery
- Self-restart capabilities
- Configuration maintenance

**Technical Implementation**: `HeartbeatRegulator` class with failsafe mechanisms.

## Features

### Self-Analysis

Continuous monitoring and analysis of system performance:

- Performance bottleneck detection
- Memory access pattern analysis
- Resource utilization tracking
- Error pattern identification

### Code Optimization

Automatic detection and optimization of inefficient patterns:

- Code refactoring suggestions
- Memory usage improvements
- Algorithm optimization
- Resource allocation adjustments

### Health Regulation

Self-healing capabilities with heartbeat monitoring:

- Error recovery mechanisms
- System restart procedures
- Configuration repair
- State restoration

### Resource Management

Intelligent allocation and optimization of system resources:

- Memory allocation optimization
- AI token usage management
- CPU/processing optimization
- Storage optimization

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { 
  AutonomyCoordinator, 
  AutonomyScheduler,
  HeartbeatRegulator 
} from 'marduk-ts';

// Initialize autonomy components
const coordinator = new AutonomyCoordinator();
const scheduler = new AutonomyScheduler();
const heartbeat = new HeartbeatRegulator(coordinator);

// Start autonomy system
scheduler.start();
heartbeat.start();

// Manually trigger analysis and optimization
const patterns = await coordinator.analyze();
console.log('Detected patterns:', patterns);

const result = await coordinator.rewrite();
console.log('Optimization results:', result.metrics);

// Stop autonomy system
scheduler.stop();
heartbeat.stop();
```

## Integration with Other Subsystems

The Autonomy System integrates with:

- **Memory System**: Analyzes and optimizes memory operations
- **Task System**: Monitors and improves task execution
- **AI System**: Uses AI capabilities for analysis and applies optimizations to AI usage

The Autonomy System acts as a meta-layer that observes and improves the entire Marduk architecture.

See the [Architecture Overview](../architecture/overview.md) for more details on system interactions.
