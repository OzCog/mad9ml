# Task System

The Task System manages the planning, prioritization, and execution of operations within Marduk, acting as the "action center" of the cognitive architecture.

## Components

### Scheduler

The Scheduler determines what tasks should be executed and when, based on:

- Priority levels
- Dependencies
- Resource availability
- Time constraints

**Technical Implementation**: `TaskScheduler` class with prioritization algorithms.

### Manager

The Task Manager tracks the execution state of tasks and handles resource allocation:

- Task creation and validation
- Execution tracking
- Resource management
- Result collection

**Technical Implementation**: `TaskManager` class implementing the task lifecycle.

### Validator

The Validator ensures tasks are well-formed and ready for execution:

- Structure validation
- Prerequisite checking
- Permission verification
- Resource availability confirmation

**Technical Implementation**: `TaskValidator` class with rule-based validation.

### Handlers

Specialized processors for different task types:

- Standard task handlers
- Deferred task handlers
- Recurring task handlers
- Conditional task handlers

**Technical Implementation**: `DeferredTaskHandler` and other specialized handler classes.

## Task Types

Marduk supports several task types:

- **Standard Tasks**: Simple, immediate execution tasks
- **Deferred Tasks**: Tasks that execute when prerequisites are met
- **Recurring Tasks**: Tasks that execute on a schedule
- **Composite Tasks**: Tasks composed of subtasks

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { TaskManager, DeferredTaskHandler } from 'marduk-ts';

const taskManager = new TaskManager();
const deferredHandler = new DeferredTaskHandler();

// Create and add a standard task
const analysisTask = taskManager.createTask('Analyze system performance', {
  priority: 2,
  target: 'performance-analyzer'
});

// Create a task with prerequisites
const optimizationTask = taskManager.createTask('Apply optimization patterns', {
  priority: 3,
  condition: {
    type: 'deferred',
    prerequisite: 'analysis-completed'
  }
});

// Add the deferred task to the handler
deferredHandler.addDeferredTask(optimizationTask);

// When prerequisite is met
const memoryState = { completedTopics: ['analysis-completed'] };
const activatedTasks = deferredHandler.activateTasks(memoryState);
activatedTasks.forEach(task => taskManager.addTask(task));

// Get prioritized tasks and execute them
const prioritizedTasks = taskManager.prioritizeTasks();
```

## Integration with Other Subsystems

The Task System integrates with:

- **Memory System**: Retrieves context information and stores results
- **AI System**: Uses AI capabilities to enhance task execution
- **Autonomy System**: Subject to optimization and monitoring

Tasks often operate on memory, invoke AI operations, or trigger autonomy processes, creating a tightly interconnected system of operations.

See the [Architecture Overview](../architecture/overview.md) for more details on system interactions.
