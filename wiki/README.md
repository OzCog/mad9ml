## About Marduk

Marduk is not just another AI framework - it's a comprehensive cognitive architecture designed to mimic the interconnected, layered processing systems of advanced intelligence. With its modular design and self-optimizing capabilities, Marduk represents a new paradigm in artificial intelligence development.

The system is built on four primary subsystems (Memory, Task, AI, and Autonomy) that work together to create a powerful, flexible foundation for advanced AI applications.
